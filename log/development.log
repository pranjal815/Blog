ActionController::UnknownFormat (PostsController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (PagesController#about is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (Author::PostsController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

We should appreciate every day our family and friends, and show them our love. We will always have someone to express our love. There are so many ways to do it. In a classic way with a letter or with a nice gift, a watch, shoes, a piece of clothing, let&rsquo;s get creative! There are so many options, and today it is so easy to buy a gift, for example at PISTIS.com I have found awesome perfumes, my favorite one is Romance by Ralph Lauren, every time I wear it I get compliments about how good I smell. </span></em></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.35cm; line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><em><span lang=\"en-US\">Expressing love can be easy and cheap! Spare your time with your family! Share good stories and adventures, good moments and create memories that last forever. Give that special person the gift she always wanted. As I mentioned there are many options, I like to buy the gifts online so that I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time and I can find specifically what I am looking for. </span></em></span></p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDUba5ah0qQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.35cm; line-height: 115%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">This Saint Valentine&rsquo;s act like the very wise Osho said once: &ldquo;Love is the goal, life is the journey.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to express your feelings for your loved ones and share this journey for the same goal with your friends and family!&nbsp;</span></span></p>"}, "commit"=>"Save", "id"=>"sixth"}

Music, literature,emotions, poetry and fashion! Yes, in our everyday life there is fashion. Every morning when you chose what to wear you are expressing something to other people. It involves the color of your&nbsp;clothes, if you chose something comfortable of something really fancy. In today&rsquo;s world looks are very important, it is the first impression you give to someone else. Yeah, we shouldn&rsquo;t judge&nbsp;people by their looks, but at the end of the day how we look represent a huge part of our identity&nbsp;and personality.&nbsp;Fashion is an important piece of every culture and age development of own identity. Expressing&nbsp;who we are and to put it into words can be a challenge; appearance style seems to offer a way of&nbsp;expressing this statement, emerging and creating identities. But fashion does not just create the&nbsp;identity of individual person; it can create a whole society. Fashion can be defined as a cultural&nbsp;phenomenon. People from Mexico don&rsquo;t dress as people from India. Fashion has created two&nbsp;different identities in these two different countries. It includes make up, accessories, hair styles&nbsp;and shoes. It has created history through the years. Just think about how your grandparents used&nbsp;to dress and how you dress? That&rsquo;s very simple, fashion so as people change over the time and it follows the popular trends of&nbsp;the moment.</p>\r\n<p>Trends from today are not the same as trends in the past years. In the 1960 and&nbsp;1970 the hippies culture made bell-bottomed blue jeans incredible popular and thanks to media&nbsp;everybody came to know about this. Fashion xpresses modernity, and symbolizes the spirit of the&nbsp;time. It will follow the popular culture of the moment, pop star, musicians, movie stars as well as&nbsp;television shows and films.</p>\r\n<p>Advertisements and media are the key for fashions industry. People&nbsp;often want to follow fashion and imitate their favorite stars.&nbsp;As mentioned before fashion represents who we are. And it can also make us improve and help us achieve success. The way you look affects other people&rsquo;s perception of your authority,&nbsp;trustworthiness, intelligence, financial success and suitability for hire or promotion in case of a job.</p>\r\n<p>Also what you wear could define how confident you feel about yourself. The way you dress will always send a message to other people for example appropriate dress is a way of expressing respect for the situation and the people in it. Informal clothing may hurt in&nbsp;negotiations situation. So now that you know this the next time you are getting ready for an&nbsp;important occasion you make sure your clothes are sending the right message.</p>"}, "commit"=>"Save", "id"=>"why-fashion-is-so-important-in-the-coming-world"}

People from Mexico don&rsquo;t dress as people from India. Fashion has created two different identities in these two different countries. It includes make up, accessories, hair styles and shoes.

People from Mexico don&rsquo;t dress as people from India. Fashion has created two different identities in these two different countries. It includes make up, accessories, hair styles and shoes.

Fashion expresses modernity, and symbolizes the spirit of the time. It will follow the popular culture of the moment, pop star, musicians, movie stars as well as television shows and films.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ContactController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

ActionController::UnknownFormat (SignupsController#create_author is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
